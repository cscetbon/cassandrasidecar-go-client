------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Type** | **string** |  | 
**Id** | **string** | unique identifier of an operation, a random id is assigned to each operation after a request is submitted, from caller&#39;s perspective, an id is sent back as a response to his request so he can further query state of that operation, referencing id, by operations/{id} endpoint  | 
**State** | **string** | state of an operation, operation might be in various states, PENDING - this operation is pending for being submitted. RUNNING - this operation is actively doing its job, COMPLETED - this operation has finished successfully, CANCELLED - this operation was interrupted while being run, FAILED - this operation has finished errorneously  |

**StartTime** | [**time.Time**](time.Time.md) | timestamp telling when this operation was started by Sidecar, if an operation is created, it does not necessarily mean that it will be started right away, in most cases it is the case but if e.g. ExecutorService is full on its working thread, an execution of an operation is postponed and start time is updated only after that  | [optional] 
**CompletionTime** | [**time.Time**](time.Time.md) | timestamp telling when an operation has finished, irrelevant of its result, an operation can be failed and it would still have this field populated.  | [optional]
